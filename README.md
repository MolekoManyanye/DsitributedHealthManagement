## Running  Docker Applications

you run the application using yml file 
-it builds the images and containers statically

1. running application:
    docker-compose up

the nodes will run at three links
['http://172.18.0.4:8083','http://172.18.0.3:8082','http://172.18.0.2:8081','http://172.18.0.5:8084','http://172.18.0.6:8085']
,   this are defined statically in the yml file

NOTE : due to static network address assignments ,  is advisable to remove all existing custom docker networks, to aavoid ip overlap causing malfunction

The SQLite database file `ntsoekhe.db` is included in the repository. It contains tables for patients, doctors, nurses, departments, appointments, medical records, prescriptions, and billings.
